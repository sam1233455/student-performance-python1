 Student Performance Analysis with Python
This project analyzes a fictional dataset of 30,000+ students to uncover how various personal, socio-economic, and educational factors impact academic performance across math, reading, and writing subjects.

🔍 Objectives:
Identify the key features that influence test scores the most.
Explore interaction effects between features such as parental education, test preparation, and study hours.
🛠️ Tools Used:
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing)
Seaborn & Matplotlib (EDA & Visualization)
🧹 Tasks Performed:
Cleaned and preprocessed data (handled missing values, categorized variables)
Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed correlations between variables and test scores
Built visualizations to support findings
📊 Key Insights:
Students who completed test prep scored significantly higher.
Higher weekly study hours correlated with better performance.
Socioeconomic factors like lunch type and parent education influenced scores.
Some combinations like "high parental education + completed test prep" showed compounding effects.
